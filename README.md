A **Self-Balancing Robot** implemented with **PID** and **LQR** controller.

### Abstract
The goal of this project is to build a two-wheeled robot capable of self-balancing. The intrinsic instability of the robot is compensated using a control implemented on the **STM32 microcontroller**. Two strategies have been adopted to obtain the control action: **PID control** and **LQR control**. The entire code is written using the **STM32 Cube IDE** using the **HAL** and **CMSIS** libraries.
